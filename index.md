## About Me

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/yue-florence-lin), with a [Designated Emphasis](https://besi.berkeley.edu/designated-emphasis-in-political-economy-de-in-pe-students/) on Political Economy. My dissertation explores a key element of de-globalization: the rising trend of advanced democracies leveraging **national security** to restrict foreign investment from both emerging and established markets. First, I unpack why, when, and how political elites do so in Congress. Second, I investigate how societal groups, such as consumers, employees, and private companies, may respond to this growing trend. Empirically, I draw on original and commercial data, elite interviews, and experimental methods (both survey and field experiments). My dissertation, titled ***Championing Economic National Security in a De-Globalized Era***, won the 2025 [Best Doctoral Dissertation Proposal](https://www.aib.world/about/awards/doctoral-dissertation-proposal/) from [Academy of International Business](https://www.aib.world/). My other projects focus on geopolitics, political risk, industrial policy, and corporate non-market strategy. I am grateful for funding support from [Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative](https://besi.berkeley.edu/), [Citrin Center for Public Opinion Research](https://live-citrin-center-for-public-opinion-research.pantheon.berkeley.edu/), [Helsinki Geoeconomics Society](https://www.geoeconomics.fi/society/), and [Institute for Humane Studies](https://www.theihs.org/). 

Prior to doctoral studies, I worked at the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/), the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), and the [Institute of New Structural Economics](https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I received an M.A. in International Economics and International Relations from Johns Hopkins University, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). I earned a B.Soc.Sci. in Government and International Relations from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I was awarded a national scholarship and graduated as the highest-ranking student.
