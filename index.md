## About Me

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/yue-florence-lin), with a Designated Emphasis on Political Economy through the [Berkeley Economy & Society Initiative](https://besi.berkeley.edu/graduate-program/), and a [Data Science & AI Fellow](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/yue-lin) at the [Data Science Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/home). In the dissertation, I study an extreme version of economic de-globalization: the rising trend of advanced democracies leveraging **national security** to restrict multinational enterprises from both emerging and established markets. First, I unpack why, when, and how political elites in host markets do so in Congress and on social media. Second, I examine the downstream reactions to this disruptive shift among societal groups (e.g., consumers and private firms) and how their responses shape the cross-border diffusion of cutting-edge technologies. I use original and commercial data, survey experiments, field experiments, and elite interviews to explore these questions. 

My dissertation, titled ***Championing Economic National Security in a De-Globalized Era***, won the 2025 [Best Doctoral Dissertation Proposal](https://www.aib.world/about/awards/doctoral-dissertation-proposal/) from [Academy of International Business](https://www.aib.world/). My other projects focus on political risk, industrial policy, and corporate non-market strategy (e.g., information). I am grateful for funding support from [Berkeley Economy & Society Initiative](https://besi.berkeley.edu/), [Citrin Center for Public Opinion Research](https://live-citrin-center-for-public-opinion-research.pantheon.berkeley.edu/), [Helsinki Geoeconomics Society](https://www.geoeconomics.fi/society/), and [Institute for Humane Studies](https://www.theihs.org/). 

Prior to doctoral studies, I worked at the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/), the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), and the [Institute of New Structural Economics](https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I received an M.A. in International Economics and International Relations from [Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University](https://sais.jhu.edu/). I earned a B.Soc.Sci. in Government and International Relations from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I was awarded a national scholarship (top 0.05%) and graduated top of my cohort.
