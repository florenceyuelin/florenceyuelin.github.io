## About Me

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Travers Department of Political Science at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/), with a [Designated Emphasis](https://n2pe.berkeley.edu/people/) on Political Economy. My dissertation explores a key element of de-globalization: the rising trend of advanced democracies leveraging **economic national security** to restrict foreign investment. First, I unpack why, when, and how political elites do so in Congress. Second, I investigate how societal groups, such as consumers, employees, and private companies, may respond to this growing trend. Empirically, my dissertation employs commercial data, elite interviews, and experiments. My other projects focus on geopolitics, political risk, industrial policy, and corporate non-market strategy. I am grateful for funding support from [Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative](https://besi.berkeley.edu/), [Citrin Center for Public Opinion Research](https://live-citrin-center-for-public-opinion-research.pantheon.berkeley.edu/), [Helsinki Geoeconomics Society](https://www.geoeconomics.fi/society/), and [Institute for Humane Studies](https://www.theihs.org/). 

Prior to doctoral studies, I gained experience at the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/), the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), and the [Institute of New Structural Economics](https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I received an M.A. in International Economics and International Relations from Johns Hopkins University, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). I earned a B.Soc.Sci. in Government and International Relations from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I was awarded a national scholarship and graduated as the highest-ranking student.
